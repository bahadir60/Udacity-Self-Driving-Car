The repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project is:
https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3

Simulators and data :

Windows 10 is only compatible with windows simulator.

I have different enviroment than orjinal one which is here:
 [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

For use my enviroment run this code in after installed anaconda with python 3.6.4;

> conda env create -f environment.yaml

Use 'movie.ipynb' which is jupyter notebook to train your model. After saved model use drive.py

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`.

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
